A full-stack e-commerce platform built with **Spring Boot (Java)** on the backend and **Vanilla JavaScript** on the frontend. The application supports core features such as product management and shopping cart functionalities, with seamless RESTful integration.

  * Users can:

    * Add new products to the catalog.
    * Add items to their cart.
    * Remove items from the cart.
